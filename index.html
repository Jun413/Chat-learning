    "Is there always a better way to learn a foreign language?" I was so caught up in the idea that
    I wasted a lot of time looking for new foreign language learning methods. And I realized that the
    best way to learn a language from a real person is to learn it.<br> It's a conversation. Learn the
    foreign language with the most efficient and fun way to learn.
